Why do I use Vim?

- I use Vim because it's everywhere
- I use Vim because it's extensible
- I use Vim because it's powerful
- I use Vim because it's free
- I use Vim because I like keyboarding
- I use Vim because it can do anything
- I use Vim because it feels like playing an instrument
- I use Vim because it's elegant
- I use Vim because it's consistent
- I use Vim because it's different, since before being different was cool
