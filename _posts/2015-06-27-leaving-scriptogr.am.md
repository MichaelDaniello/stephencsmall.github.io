title: Leaving Scriptogr.am
---

I used to run a blog on Scriptogr.am.

Then I grew a brain, and a heart.

I wanted to extend my Markdown obsession right through to the Web 2.0 era,
I wanted to write a blog in pure Markdown.  At first that's what I thought
I wanted.

What I really wanted was to have a static site that used the basic learnable
web technologies and maybe had some blog-like components. I wanted to write
postings like this that were long form text, and I wanted to
be able to do it from within my favorite editor.  A colleague showed me Jekyll
and I was interested in a "yeah that'd be cool except ruby, servers, blah..."
kind of way.  It promised to take whatever Markdown I could come up with and
spin it into a static site (which is exactly what I wanted) but it requires
hosting and a server to run the custom Jekyll server.  OH WAIT GitHub Pages is
free hosting.  What better way to advertise your coding than with more coding
hosted by coding. Did I mention coding?

So today I've cut over my old (not very great) blog content from
blog.smallnet.us to here.  It's also expanding, as I've written more markdown
since I stopped putting it in Dropbox.  I've written up a very Bootstrap-y blog
that has some simple layouts and includes, and it's going to grow into my
personal website.  It's a great excuse to learn some web design tricks as well.
Stay tuned.
