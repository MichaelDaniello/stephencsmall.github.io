title: The Terminal shall set you free
---

Since I started working professionally, I've had a fascination with the command line. Sure, I respected it in college, but it wasn't until I was using it every day that I realized the power of what I was working with.  Since then I've become much more well accustomed to the CLI lifestyle. Here's just a smattering of what I'm doing strictly in my terminal these days:

- Multiple windows with tmux
- Powerful editing experience in Vim
- Work and personal email in mutt
- XMPP chat with profanity
- IRC chat with irssi
- Local music library in cmus
- Stream Pandora using pianobar
- Demonstrate keen style with vim-promptline, vim-airline
- Extend my shelling with zsh / oh-my-zsh
- Manage my tasks with todo.txt
